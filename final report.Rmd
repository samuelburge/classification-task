# Supervised Learning Task

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Methodology

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Results

We can put a description of the results, like a table of the average training and cross-validation errors, in this section. I was also thinking we could include ROC curves.

# Unsupervised Learning Task

Text here.

```{r pca, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
